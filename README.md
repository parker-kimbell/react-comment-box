## React Comment Box Solution

This is my solution for the classic comment box tutorial for React.

To run this you'll need to start up the included local Node server. I kept the server local for the sake of simplicity.

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

Open your browser to the localhost port that is printed in the server console to view the app. It's functionality is to give the user the ability to add comments to a local database and coordinate the views of that data between clients.
